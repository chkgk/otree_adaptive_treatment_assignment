        # Initially, all treatments are equally likely to be assigned.
        # As soon as the first player completes the experiment, the weighting starts.
        # Lets assume the first player to finish is in treatment A.
        # Thus, the weights shift such that A, B, C are now assigned with probabilities [0, 0.5, 0.5].
        # These stay the same until the next player completes the experiment.
        # The problem is, that it takes time for players to reach the end of the experiment.
        # During the time it takes the next person to finish, we only assign treatments B and C in this example.
        # Then, suddenly, a wave of those B and C players arrive at the end of the experiment.
        #
        # Now, A will look under-sampled and the weights shift accordingly.
        # There are multiple ways to solve the issue:
        # A naive way is implemented here. We only start weighted assignment once a threshold is reached.
        #
        # A better way would be to also take the distribution of treatments among those players into account,
        # that are currently playing, but have not yet completed the experiment.
        # The problem then is, that you would have to track whether they are still "active" or
        # whether they have dropped out (could set a dropped-out flag if they ever miss a timeout).
        # It will also be difficult to "tune" the method to strike a good balance between achieving the goal
        # of an equal number of participants in each treatment (completed) and the aggressiveness of the weighting.
